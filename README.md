## CodySynapse

### Project Description
**CodySynapse** is an advanced machine learning project focused on developing a sophisticated model for comparing and analyzing code snippets across different programming languages, initially concentrating on **Java** and **JavaScript**. The project employs **Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs)** to assess functional equivalence between code snippets, irrespective of their implementation language.

### Key Features
- **Cross-language code comparison** (Java and JavaScript)
- **Utilization of Siamese Neural Networks** for deep learning
- **Embedding-based code representation**
- **Scalable architecture** for future multi-language support
- **Integration potential** with popular IDEs and development tools

### Dataset Characteristics
- **Size**: Initially targeting 10,000 paired snippets (scalable to 100,000+)
- **Languages**: Java and JavaScript (extensible to other languages)
- **Categorization**: Labeled as functionally equivalent or non-equivalent
- **Diversity**: Covers various programming paradigms, difficulty levels, and application domains

### Data Collection Methods
- **Open-source project mining**: Extracting snippets from popular JavaScript libraries and frameworks.
- **Automated translation**: Using tools like Babel for code transformation (with manual verification).
- **Expert contributions**: Snippets created by experienced developers in both languages.
- **Crowdsourcing**: Moderated contributions from the developer community.
- **Data augmentation**: Generating variations from existing paired snippets algorithmically.
