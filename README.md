## CodySynapse
#Project Description
CodeSynapse is an advanced machine learning project aimed at developing a sophisticated model for comparing and analyzing code snippets across different programming languages, initially focusing on Java and Dart. The project utilizes Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs) to determine functional equivalence between code snippets, regardless of their implementation language.
#Key Features:
Cross-language code comparison (Java and Dart)
Utilization of Siamese Neural Networks for deep learning
Embedding-based code representation
Scalable architecture for future multi-language support
Potential for integration with IDEs and development tools
#Dataset Characteristics:
Size: Initially targeting 10,000 paired snippets (scalable to 100,000+)
Languages: Java and Dart (extensible to other languages in future versions)
Categorization: Labeled as functionally equivalent or non-equivalent
Diversity: Covers various programming paradigms, difficulty levels, and application domains
Data Collection Methods:
Open-source project mining: Extraction from projects with Java and Dart implementations
Automated translation: Utilization of advanced code translation APIs with manual verification
Expert contributions: Snippets created by experienced developers in both languages
Crowdsourcing: Carefully moderated contributions from the developer community
Data augmentation: Algorithmic generation of variations from existing paired snippets
